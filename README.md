# ML-Assignment

## Questions
1. Analyze the training data. Is there a variable which is highly correlated to another variable? List all
variables with correlation coefficients ≥ 0.9.
2. Assume you can only choose one feature to predict the mass as well as possible. Which variable do you
select? Explain why you select this variable and show the relevant numbers (p-value and R2
-value).
3. Build a linear regression model which uses as many input variables as required. Keep in mind that
each sensor costs money, so remove variables which are not needed from the model. List the selected
variables and the relevant numbers for selecting them (p-value and R2
-value).
4. Use the selected model to predict the mass on the test data. Compare the training MSE to the test
MSE. How does your model perform on the test data?
5. Add higher-order terms, such as quadratic terms or interaction terms to improve the model. Judge the
model quality (R2 values). Again, compare the training MSE to the test MSE.

## Conditions
1. The next two weeks (week 5 and 6 of the semester), you independently work on this assignment.
Attendance is not required for these two weeks. The lab 6.004 is available to you at the normal hours,
if you need a computer with Python, Matlab, and RStudio installed, or if you need any help with the
assignment.
2. You write a short report which answers the questions below and summarizes your findings. The report
should be 1 – 2 pages A4 and written in German or English.
3. The report is due on Friday, 25 October 2019 at 17:00. Please also hand in all code written for this
assignment. The report in PDF form and all code have to be sent to sjecklin@hsr.ch. Add the subject
(Betreff) ML-Assignment to the email.
4. Everybody hands in their own report. Collaboration and discussion between students, however, is
allowed and encouraged.
